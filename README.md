The proliferation of digital media has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake news. Fake news, characterized by false or misleading information presented as factual, can spread rapidly through social media and other online platforms. This misinformation can influence public opinion, affect elections, and contribute to societal polarization. The challenge lies in developing effective methods to identify and filter out fake news while ensuring that legitimate information is accurately represented. 
Addressing this problem is crucial for maintaining informed public discourse and preventing the detrimental effects of misinformation.
